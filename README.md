## About

This application encodes .tic cartridges for TIC-80 into barcodes for distribution

## Ending words

The application is very bare bones and more of an idea.  
The project is as it stands very gimmicky and not that useful,
but i quite like the idea of storing TIC-80 cartridges in barcodes
for distribution and i can only imagine what kinds of stuff you could pull of,
like scanning a barcode on mobile and playing it directly through some kind of app.
